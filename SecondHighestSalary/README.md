# LeetCode SQL Solution â€” Second Highest Salary

## Problem Statement
Table: `Employee`

| Column Name | Type    |
|-------------|---------|
| id          | int     |
| salary      | int     |

`id` is the primary key for this table.  
Each row contains salary information of an employee.

Write a SQL query to report the **second highest salary** from the `Employee` table.  
If there is no second highest salary, the result should be `null`.
